# GAN-RMFC-Div-A-CCG
The project implements CycleGAN for unpaired image-to-image translation, transforming celebrity photos into cartoon-style images and vice versa, using deep convolutional neural networks

## Overview
This project implements a Cycle Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) for transforming celebrity photographs into cartoon representations and vice versa. The CycleGAN framework enables unpaired image translation, allowing the model to learn the mapping between different image domains without the need for paired training data.


## Features
- Transform celebrity photos into cartoon images and vice versa.
- Leverages cycle consistency loss for training without paired data.
- Offers opportunities for creative image manipulation and style transfer.

## Requirements
- Python (version 3.10)
- TensorFlow (version 3.0.9)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Future Improvements
- Enhance model architecture for better image translation quality.
- Optimize training parameters for faster convergence.
- Explore additional loss functions or regularization techniques.
- Expand dataset to include more diverse celebrity images and cartoon styles.
